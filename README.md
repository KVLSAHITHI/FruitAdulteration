# FruitAdulteration


This Project is about Detecting the Adulteration in the fruits using CNN i.e Convolutional Neural Networks
the files contains of GUI,Main and Training the testing model 
install the required modules before running the particular file
The model is 80% accurate because we dont have a particular threshold value to check the fruit is pure or adulterated.
the datasets you can get from the online but they need to be very large in size to train the model accurately
